From version v3.65 uLaunchELF supports use of USB keyboard, both for entry of
file and folder names, and for general control and navigation, in which the
keyboard can be used as a replacement for the gamepad. In fact you can use
either gamepad in parallel with the keyboard too. That's entirely up to you,
as all three controllers remain active at once in uLaunchELF.

When used for entry of file/folder names, the following 'mapping' applies:

KB_Left      => Move cursor left
KB_Right     => Move cursor right
KB_Backspace => Delete character to the left (if any) and move cursor there
KB_Delete    => Delete character to the right (if any)
KB_Home      => Move cursor to start of string
KB_End       => Move cursor to end of string
KB_Escape    => End entry dialog as Canceled (new string will not be used)
KB_Enter     => End entry dialog as OK (new string will be used)

The mapping described above takes precedence over the one described below,
so when entering file/folder names the mapping described below is not used.

When used as generic controller most gamepad buttons have more than one
equivalent key on the keyboard. This is because many different keyboard
types exist, and different users have different preferences. Hopefully
most users will find at least one of the available button sets convenient.

L1    == KB_F1    or '1'      R1      == KB_F12  or '0'
L2    == KB_F2    or '2'      R2      == KB_F11  or '9'
L3    == KB_F3    or '3'      R3      == KB_F10  or '8'
Up    == KB_Up    or 'w'      Triangle== KB_Home or 'i' or KB_Escape
Left  == KB_Left  or 'a'      Square  == KB_End  or 'j'
Right == KB_Right or 's'      Circle  == KB_PgUp or 'k'
Down  == KB_Down  or 'z'      Cross   == KB_PgDn or 'm'
Select== KB_Insert            Start   == KB_Delete

In addition to the above, two keys are mapped differently depending on
the button mapping you have chosen for Circle/Cross in uLaunchELF.

KB_Enter will mean OK/Activate
KB_Space will mean Cancel/Mark
